# A.L.I.C.E.-Ability-Life-Improvers-for-Children-Experience
A.L.I.C.E. (Ability &amp; Life Improvers for Children Experience) is a project born from the collaboration between OBM (Open Biomedical Initiative) and EFP (Energy Family Project) and, it’s purpose is to create orthopedic aids to improve children’s daily activities. Children who suffer from agenesis, malformations and limb amputations. Thanks to the collaboration of over 300 families belonging to EFP, we have developed a survey to identify the major difficulties that children encounter during common daily activities. The questions asked in the survey included that the parent identified himself with his child and suggested difficulties, solutions adopted and new ideas. The survey revealed 27 critical issues such as cycling, using a zip or holding a fork during meals. Pent4silea working group first analyzed the difficulties by submitting them to its own team of specialists and than published them to receive help from people from all over world interested in this sector. The entire project lives thanks to an open source perspective both to be able to benefit from the contribution of users from all over the world and to be able to help anyone who needs these orthopedic aids. The project is still open and new proposals and collaborations are welcome.
